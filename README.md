# Getting Started


## Theme Assets
Make sure these directoryies are empty when starting a new project.

 /assets/images/ 
 /assets/webfonts/

## Customizing CSS
Add custom CSS to the custom-style.scss file located in /assets/css/scss/_custom-styles.scss. Erase _custom-style.scss and recompile the theme-style.scss when starting a new a project. 

## Custom Post Types & Taxonomies
The theme functions.php will automatically load files in the /types/ directory. To add a custom post type, simply create a file in the /types/ directory and label it as the post type. For example, a custom post type for "Projects"  would be labeled projects.php. Custom taxonomes should be saved in the /taxonomies/ directoy.
